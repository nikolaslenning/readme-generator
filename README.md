## Description
Readme Generator is a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md from a user's input. The motivation behind creating this application was to accelerate and simplify the process of creating a quality readme for any future applications. The purpose of this application is to allow more time to be spent working on a project, rather than spending time creating a exceptional readme.

## Installation
The steps required to install this application are as follows:
 1. Depending on user, open either the Command Prompt, PowerShell, or Terminal. 
 2. Go to the command line and navigate to the appropriate folder houseing the readme generator program. 
 3. Run the command line program by typing "node index.js" and pressing Enter
 4. Follow the prompts and questions to generate a readme using the information provided. 

## Usage
The application will be invoked with the following command:
```
node index.js
```
